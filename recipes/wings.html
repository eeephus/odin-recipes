    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cook these classic Buffalo wings in an air fryer or on the stove, then toss them in a buttery hot sauce and serve
        with creamy blue cheese sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>10 small (1 pound total) chicken drumettes, patted dry</li>
        <li>10 small (13 ounces total) chicken wing flats, patted dry</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buffalo-style hot sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet. Pour vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven to a depth of 2
            inches; heat oil to 375°F over medium. Fry chicken drumettes and wing flats in 2 batches until golden brown
            and until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers at least 165°F, 6 to 8 minutes.
            Transfer to wire rack.</li>
        <li>While chicken cooks, bring hot sauce and butter to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium, whisking
            occasionally. Simmer, whisking occasionally, until sauce is slightly thickened and coats the back of a
            spoon, about 1 minute. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place Buffalo Wings and sauce in a large bowl; toss until wings are evenly coated. Transfer to a platter,
            and serve with Blue Cheese Dressing and celery sticks.</li>
    </ol>
